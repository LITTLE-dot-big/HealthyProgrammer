# HealthyProgrammer
This is a program which plays a music track (object) after a fixed interval of time (adjustable, as per the needs). 
One can use this program as a reminder to drink water, care for his eye, and do stretching at stipulated time intervals.

Note: You have to save three audio files in the same directory where you will pull this project. The names of the three audio files HAVE TO BE: 1. "Water.ogg", 2. "Exercise.ogg" and 3. "Eye.ogg".
